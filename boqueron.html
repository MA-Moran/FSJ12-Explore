          <p> El Boquerón is a protected natural area located on top of the San Salvador volcano <br>
            at 1,800 meters 5,905 feet (1,800 meters) above sea level, part of the <br>
            Central American country of El Salvador. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The park's main attraction is a crater 1.5 kilometers in diameter and 558 meters deep. <br>
            In addition there is a small crater in the main crater called "Boqueroncito" (in reference <br>
            to the Boquerón crater). El Boquerón has a cool temperate climate throughout the year. <br>
            The park is home to many plant species identified as ornamental plants, such as "Cartridges",<br>
            hydrangeas, begonias, among others. There is wildlife, such as armadillos, raccoons, deer, foxes, among others.

            It has a visitor center and is an ideal place for nature lovers who are visiting San Salvador <br>
            for a short time, since this natural area is very close to the capital and offers a tour of <br>
            about 40 minutes with a wide view of the volcano and the city. A bit of history of this out-of-activity <br>
            volcano is essential to broaden your knowledge of El Salvador and enjoy spectacular views <br>
            of the city. The tour is carried out along marked trails with easy access, although those visitors <br>
            who want to climb up to the anchovy must be in good physical condition.
