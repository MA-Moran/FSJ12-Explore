Homework - Bootcamp - Tourist Places
This is the work of a homework only using HTML &CSS.
Keeping in mind that we had already touched a few bootstrap and javascrip uses in webpages
at the point in the bootcamp, when this homework was given. I decided to literally make this
page as it it was 2014-2015 when I was in High School learning just for fun how to do a website
as to not try to add things that where not CSS.

Is a very simple and old looking website, I hope you like looking at the pictures!
